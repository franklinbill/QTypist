# QTypist
A tool to automatically generate the input text. It is like an intelligent typist writing correct input text according to different mobile app input scenarios.

We give source code (./source code/). Please note that our LLM uses OpenAI API. Please replace it with your OpenAI key. Thank you very much for your support for our work!

The use of OpenAI API has been described in detail in Readme. The generation method of training data is also given in Readme.


As shown in the following table, it is all our patterns.

You can get the code and tuning data through our code.

Fine tune your gpt-3 as follows, and the effect is the same.

1.We recommend using our OpenAI command-line interface (CLI). To install this, run
`pip install --upgrade openai`

2.(The following instructions work for version 0.9.4 and up. Additionally, the OpenAI CLI requires python 3.)

Set your OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable by adding the following line into your shell initialization script (e.g. .bashrc, zshrc, etc.) or running it in the command line before the fine-tuning command:

`export OPENAI_API_KEY="<OPENAI_API_KEY>"`

3.Prepare training data

Training data is how you teach GPT-3 what you'd like it to say.
Your data must be a JSONL document, where each line is a prompt-completion pair corresponding to a training example. You can use CLI data preparation tool to easily convert your data into this file format.

`{"prompt": "<prompt text>", "completion": "<ideal generated text>"}`

4. CLI data preparation tool
We developed a tool which validates, gives suggestions and reformats your data:

`openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f <LOCAL_FILE>`

5. Create a fine-tuned model

`openai api fine_tunes.create -t <TRAIN_FILE_ID_OR_PATH> -m Curie`

6. After you've started a fine-tune job, it may take some time to complete. Your job may be queued behind other jobs on our system, and training our model can take minutes or hours depending on the model and dataset size. If the event stream is interrupted for any reason, you can resume it by running:

`openai api fine_tunes.follow -i <YOUR_FINE_TUNE_JOB_ID>`

7. Use a fine-tuned model

`openai api completions.create -m <FINE_TUNED_MODEL> -p <YOUR_PROMPT>`

`curl https://api.openai.com/v1/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": YOUR_PROMPT, "model": FINE_TUNED_MODEL}'`
  
 `
import openai
openai.Completion.create(
    model=FINE_TUNED_MODEL,
    prompt=YOUR_PROMPT)`

Since the API of gpt-3 contains personal information, we will give our fine tuned API after the double-blind review.

The key words of our approach are shown in the table.


The data construction algorithm code is as follows:


\begin{algorithm}  
  \caption{Heuristic-based training data construction}  
  \KwIn{
       $vhief$: associated view hierarchy file\;
       $category$: category of input widget\;
       }  
  \KwOut{$con$: constructed input content;}  
  
  Traverse $vhief$ to obtain EditText / TextView / Spinner / ListView\;
  Obtain the coordinates of EditText / TextView / Spinner / ListView  ($x_1$,$y_1$),($x_2$,$y_2$)\;
  \textcolor{gray}{//coordinate of upper left and lower right}\;
  Obtain text of TextView ($text$)\;
  Obtain hint-text of EditText ($htext$)\;
  
  \If{$category==`filled\ content$'}
  {
    \If{`search, add, input, enter' not in $htext$} 
    {
        $con\gets$ $htext$\;
    }
  }
  
  \If{$category==`search\ list$'}
  {
    \If{`search, input' in $htext$ and $Ey_2 > Ly_1$} 
    {
        obtain items of listview $item$\;
        $title\gets$ gettitle($item$)\;
        $con\gets$ $title$\;
    }
  }
  
  \If{$category==`popup\ menu$'}
  {
    \If{$Tx_2 < Sx_1$} 
    {
        obtain items of Spinner $item$\;
        $text\gets$ getSpinnertext($item$)\;
        $con\gets$ $text$\;
    }
  }
  
  \If{$category==`setting content$'}
  {
    \If{`setting' in $activityname$} 
    {
        obtain items of listview $item$\;
        $T1,T2\gets$ getTextView($item$)\;
        \If{$T1x_2 < T2x_1$ and $T1y_1 = T2y_1$} 
        {
            $con\gets$ $title$\;
        }
    }
  }

  return $con$\;

## Pilot Study Dataset (./experiment/)

We give the pilot study dataset (./motivation/)

The pilot study dataset for motivation section. 

They are the screenshot with text input from Rico, which contains 7000+ screenshots.

Because the storage space of GitHub is limited to 2GB (we use 90% of it), we provide the screenshot, and the rview hierachy file can be downloaded on Rico.

After the double-blind review, we also will upload all of them to my Google drive.


We give experiment dataset (./experiment/)

## Dataset (./experiment/)
The experimental dataset for effectiveness evaluation and usefulness evaluation. 
The first is the apks from effectiveness evaluation, which contains 106 apps, the app information as shown in table.

Because the storage space of GitHub is limited to 2GB, we provide the first 85 apks, and the rest can be downloaded on Google play through the information in the table.

After the double-blind review, we will upload all of them to my Google drive.
